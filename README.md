# Fall Detection Device

A portable fall detection device using MPU6050, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, SIM800, and Python-based alert logic.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team KLANX

This project was built by **Team KLANX** during a hackathon, where we collaboratively worked on both the **hardware** and **software** components.

- Sensor: MPU6050 for motion detection
- Controller: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Communication: SIM800 module for alert messaging
- Battery: 800mAh Lithium
- Language: Python for logic and device integration

We designed and developed the entire solution as a team â€” from circuit building to code logic â€” to create a reliable and portable fall detection system.
